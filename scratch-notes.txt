No one really gives a shit about what you have to say. Publish it!

You *will* go through the roller-coaster ride that is "I'm-a-hero-I'm-a-loser-I'm-the-next-markzuckerberg/billgates/brin-page-I'm-a-worthless-know-nothing-ooh-I'm-really-in-to-this-now". Seriously, I'm pretty confident that everyone goes through a similar cycle to this.

Old (now) addage:
If you're not embarrassed when you publish it, you're publishing too late.

Normalisation

Change the:

##### Norms
* Stigmatise: weak, sick or in some sense "Other"

##### Market
* Regulate the market: subsidise

##### Architecture
* Characterise differently

These are done both at the governing/administration as well as personal level.

Mix of these modalities works depending on the circumstances. Pushing on different modes will make changes flow in different strengths and ways.

Paraphrasing [Lawrence Lessig](http://blip.tv/lessig/what-thing-regulates-law-6597278) talking about something completely different.
