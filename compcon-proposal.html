    This talk will be conveying as much of this week-long course as is possible in the time available, as seen through the eyes of a graduating student who was always keen about open source yet who hadn&#39;t made their first pull-requests until during this course. Now, more than a year later, the presenter is actively involved in several open source projects and will be talking about some of the characteristics of the open source community today and describing in specific detail about how to become involved. The presenter will discuss the highs, the lows, the awkwardness and unique sense of connection and achievement that can only be fulfilled by contributing to open source.

    I spoke at PyConAU last year about open source participation, this talk contained similar themes, though is essentially different from the talk proposed above:

    It&#39;s a long way to come (from Perth) and I don&#39;t really have a good reason to come except that I love the idea of this conference and just want to hang out at CECS again. Not having graduated that long ago I&#39;m still finding my feet financially, so any kind of travel support would make a big difference!

    Specifically I&#39;d want to cover the following -- these topics will probably takes up about 85% of a 30(/25+5) minute presentation:
    <br />
    The definition and history of &quot;Open Source&quot;; about COMP8440: the nature, arc, timeline and culture of different projects and communities; project governance; version control; specific step-by-step instructions
   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    on
   </span>
   <span class="c0">
    &nbsp;how to become involved in an existing project depending
   </span>
   <span class="c1">
    on
   </span>
   <span class="c0">
    &nbsp;its factors; guidelines for starting/open-sourcing a new project; guidelines for maintaining and continuing involvement with projects with a broad overview of some of the classes of problems encountered and how to mitigate or resolve these.
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c2">
   <span class="c0">
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3">
   <span class="c0">
    Time permitting the following topics would be touched upon:
   </span>
  </p>
  <p class="c3">
   <span class="c0">
    Real world schemas; slightly deeper dive into version control systems (for fun and profit, eg github v. gcode v. bitbucket v. roll-your-own); some funny/facepalm lawyer/licensing stories from Tridge (samba has really seen it all); educating others about the &ldquo;open&rdquo; mentality. Also a mention about normalising female participation in general and particularly in Open Source. For a 30 minute presentation I&#39;d probably give 2-3 minutes to this last item and ditch the rest.
