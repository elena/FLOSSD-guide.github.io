# VCS (nowadays git)

#DVCS wars

# 3rd great era, it may change again
- sourceforge and github
- bear in mind git is a bit arse to use still, 2st great DVCS
- article so recently as 2007! lauding sourceforge

# Start small
- take nothing else away
- Linus Stallman von Neuman
- drive by shootings, gotta know you, trust you

# Find out how/who communicate

# Find out how to commit

"STYLE"
Learn the “style” of the existing project. Phrasing, structure, etc.
There will probably be rules. Follow them. eg: PEP8
If in doubt: copy
Don’t make up a new style, you’ll look like a fool -- ASK!

# Expect to get rejected
# Most patches aren't good enough
- massive mistake, giving it away for free
 >> stable working > ego (sorry.) (Jeremy Rusten)

That's why concept of "core" exists
- ecosystem around
- build up ranks
- make plugins

Serious, dedicated, committed professional people

# whose time is precious
- committers are a very limited resource

# Different things matter to different people
- In professional environment this sucks, in open source this is magic

# Don't think people will have the same motive as you (Tridg)
- people without a good ethical sense are in FOSS too


Punch your weight
Play your strength
(confident, easy: dinner parties/marathons)
Realistic expectations
Every project needs: designers, content makers, writers


%-
If you are not a coder
# LEARN GITHUB
- $ git clone
- commit, push, pull

 >> in 2014 this is the advice,
 this may change but we're at a highwater mark for github right now

>> conceptually it goes something like this:

- #1 reach out
|notice itch
|find code
|eyeball community

- #2 do your thing
|fork
|clone
|grep (or code, etc)
|commit, push (to your version)

- #3 send back
|pull request
|(comment/email)

%# Learn to Look
- rather than being a user
think like a contributor
reporting bugs, documentation, trivial stuff (spelling, pep8)
# Change your brain: learn to look for ways you can help

%"Parkinson's Law of Triviality"

//HOWTO PROJECT OWNER
$ teaching grandma to suck eggs

Start project:
 - Daniel/Kenneth/Jessica/Daniele
 - pull request zero
 - firefighter/anti-bikeshedder

# Be Cordial
 - sleeper in your ranks
 - participation is function of social participation
 >> research shows length of time

# Recognition!
  >> one of the main motivations

# Phrase your problem in a way that's easily accessible to person w/ right skills
 >> offer recognition

# Puppy
# Recognise it takes work to get work done
# Have a non-code person who answers pull requests
# Automate all the things

# Let go
- write down everything need to do
- highlight everything you love
- give everything else away

# Embrace your churn
- According to the research (yes, research)
  people hang around projects on average between 3 months and 2 years
  *people change*
- how lone they stick around is direct function of their "social engagement" (emails, irc, bugs, etc)

# Same people! different pies
- common in community
- be respectful!

People tend not to answer the question they're asked (Jeremy Rusten)
 >> finding requirements is hard (deep understanding)
 - get other people to do this

%#Finding
- Find tools your friends are using (best support!)
- Use things that are easy to install (be kind to yourself, this day and age no need to suffer, do messed-up stuff later)



//GENERAL

# Tools
- VCS:
  git, hg, svn

//TAKE FOR GRANTED

# Tools
- Mailing-lists/IRC (not as obvious as it seems)
- Learn to use: Issue tracker
  "Design decision needed"/"close"v."feedback" fields should and shouldn’t use

(spend ... time ... studying these things)
(a very large number of us a self-taught from other fields)

# Tools
- Text Editor
  (pick a good one, learn to use it well)
- Source Control Management (SCM)
  (eg: git)

# Tools
- Learn to use: Command Line (CLI)
  wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration
- grep (or ack) and find
- Regular Expressions (aka: regex)

(these take YEARS to learn!)
(these are our basic skills, we spend most of the time with them)

# Tools
- WRITE (clearly)
- Popular markups: ReST Markdown


//PARTICIPATION

# SAYING: I DON’T KNOW
- On feeling stupid: Everyone does. Everyone is about most things.
  The “best” leverage this to their advantage (usually very humble.)
  Harry Kroto, HE ... was

# ASK/LISTEN Rule of Thumb: (@pydanny)
- stuck for 1⁄2 hour.
- Go to: IRC, mailing-list
- Don’t agonise, spare yourself the pain!
  Often:
  ~ experienced people can see/feel you struggling (but seldom say anything)
  ~ so, in short term you feel like gumby BUT: learn something, might actually look clever ~ in medium term: your corpus is building faster

# terse təәrs/ adjective
ASK/EXPLAIN State as simply as possible. State it up front.
Time is precious: be terse
1. sparing in the use of words; abrupt. "a terse statement"
synonyms: brief, short, to the point, concise, succinct, crisp, pithy, incisive,
No fluffy language, no big explanation. BE CORDIAL but just get to the core of it.

# Don't be douche about other people's FOSS technical solutions currently working
- spreadsheets

# Turn up
- Decisions are made by the people who turn up.
- Hackerspaces User Groups Conferences
  Congratulations you are already here. Connect and develop.

# SET PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS
Probably the most valuable thing I’ve learnt in the last 5 years.
 - TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU’RE DOING
   - For their sake.
   - Save them from wondering.
 - DO WHAT YOU SAY YOU’RE GOING TO DO (18%)
   - But, if you can’t communicate!
   - FOSS people are spectacularly understanding.

"Start where you are, Use what you've got, Do what you can"
- Skud

# Don’t get disheartened.
- All mistakes will eventually be washed clean by time and entropy.
- Communities are very robust.

22.5 minute alarm:
# Question: SOMEONE WHO HASN'T CONTRIBUTED BUT WANTS TO
- What do you *want* to give to a project (create/do/build)
- What do you feel is stopping you?
- If you don't, but want to, why?


Fin:

# Interesting times
- Tech is becoming mainstream: Culture is changing
- Stream-lined ability to contribute/communicate.
- Re-learning old lessons.
- Demographic imbalance: Not just chicks, it’s older, multicultural.

# CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS
Difference is a continuum. Shared culture and technical knowledge. Skills!

People currently going in to CS (2013 USA highschool cs placement)
Still a white-boy sport
50|18 (female)
22|08 (hispanic)

- POTENTIAL
- shy, nerdy, curious little girl(/boy) who were elbowed out of the way all their lives
  >> don't want all
- Continuum (skatepark)

- Copyright: Post-GPLv3 world
- Patents: revolution is coming


# Interesting times fin
- "Software"
- mainstreaming

- expropriation of "open source"
  farms, cars, localised economies

- Technical participation is changing

- There will always be some form of “Open Source”.
- People like us will make it happen.
- FLOSS will probably change the world (probably already has)
- FLOSS may play a pivotal role in saving the world (from ourselves)
- Disconnection between people and digital technology (shouldn't be, not insurmountable problem)x
