Centralized Version Control
<div class="halfR">
<h2><strong>SCCS</strong> (1972)<br />
<strong>RCS</strong> (1982)<br />
<strong>CVS</strong> (1986/9)<br />
<strong>SVN</strong> (2000)</h2>
Most of the Free Software ever developed.

All open source.

Distributed Version Control
DVCS wars early 2000s

Big difference surrounds "Forking":
Centralized "Forking" is BAD, and discouraged and is often an act of aggression
Distributed "Forking" is the first thing you do.

VCS may change again
- sourceforge and github
- bear in mind `git` is a bit arse to use still
- article so recently as 2007! lauding sourceforge

//CONCENTRATE

- $ git clone
- commit, push, pull

 >> in 2014 this is the advice,


>> conceptually it goes something like this:

- #1 reach out
|notice itch
|find code
|eyeball community

- #2 do your thing
|fork
|clone
|grep (or code, etc)
|commit, push (to your version)

- #3 send back
|pull request
|(comment/email)


#START SMALL
> be thorough
