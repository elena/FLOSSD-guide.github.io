%#Things you can do as <strong>coder</strong>
<p><b>Code Review incoming patches</b>
  (can do anonymously)<p>
<p><b>Fix HTML or markup</b></p>
<p><b>Bug replication</b></p>
<p><b>Test out a beta or release candidate</b><br>(and do bug replications)</br>
<p><b>Help out on the <strong>Users list</strong>/IRC</b><br>
  (fielding questions)</p>

%#Things you can do as a <strong>coder</strong>
<p>Spend most your time:
<br>documenting
<br>maintaining
<br>fixing
<br>testing
<br><strong>reading</strong> code</p>
>>It's not all about the uber-ego commits

%#Things you can do as a <strong>coder</strong>
<h3>(Not 1%) Projects are really Flexible</h3>
- (Not top 1%), but rest FOSS is really flexible.
<p>Young projects can turn on a dime for your idea.</p>
<p>Envisioning and implementing <strong>all the details</strong><br>
  is expensive for new projects.</p>
>>Maybe it *is* about the uber-ego commits

"Don't be in the cave"

Doesn't matter how smart your are, if you can't work in a team/reach concensus.
You will not be successful.

Lot of insecurity, nobody wants to look stupid.
"Myth of the Genius Programmer"


Failure is necessary.
Hot white fear you get, if you're going to: fail fast!
Failure is not a option is BS, failing on the same thing repeatedly.
Don't assign blame.

Rarely document failures.
Stop talking in private.

%"Parkinson's Law of Triviality"
<blockquote>1957 argument that organizations give disproportionate weight to trivial issues</blockquote>
<p>No domain experience/knowledge required</p>
<p>Only invested people allowed to bikeshed</p>
- beware of projects with a very well discussed logo and no code
>> It's easy to get sucked in to non-technically-threatening discussions, fight this compulsion.<br>
(unless your advice is specifically ask for!)

Get more than 5 people *you can't do anything*.
time and effort inversely proportional to complexity of project

If you are not a coder
<h2>LEARN GITHUB</h2>
<p>This is the <strong>2014</strong> advice.<br>
 this may change but we're at a highwater mark for github right now</p>
Be comfortable with how to make contributions and everything else will be fine.


If you are not a coder
<h2>Use the tools your friends are using</h2>
 (the best support!)
<p>But use things that are <strong>easy to install</strong><br>
 (be kind to yourself, this day and age no need to suffer,
<br>can be all 'hardcore' later, crawl first.)

%#Things you can do as a <strong>non-coder</strong>
<p>Code Review (learning)<br>
Every project needs: designers, content makers, writers

# The world needs more technical lawyers!
- sincerely Eben Moglin, Karen Sandler

# The world needs more designers
- fight the "programming since 8" phenomenon


Things you can do
<h3>Ask your employer!</h3>
<p>Give back donate some of your time to the projects you use at work.</p>
<p>Openly License your internal packages/projects.</p>
I hear some of these projects can be quite popular *coughdjangocough.



%#Finding projects
<h3>YOU ARE AT A CONFERENCE NOW!</h3>
<p>- sprints</p>
<p>Tools/projects <strong>you use</strong></p>
<p>Projects <strong>people you know</strong> are working on</p>
<p>Projects within your <strong>"domain"</strong> (hockey, GIS, pigeon-racing)</p>
>> "Learn to look" redux: change your brain to looking
