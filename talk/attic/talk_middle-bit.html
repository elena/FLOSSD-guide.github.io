%# Kinds of projects
<p>How <strong>old</strong> is the project?</p>
<p>Where in its <strong>lifecycle</strong> is it?<br>
~ New project<br>
~ Active progression<br>
~ Mature, maintenance phase<br>
~ Dead</p>

<h2>Learn to Look</h2>
<p>Have a good <strong>internal sense</strong> of when you're using
Free Software
(which I trust everyone here does ...)

Think like a Contributor
<h2>Learn to Look</h2>
<p>Rather than being a passive user, make an effort:</p>
<p>- Replicate bugs<br>
  - Read and understand documentation<br>
  <span class="gap">(for clarity and coherence)</span><br>
   - Details, details, details (spelling, cruft)</p>
You're contributing your time and energy (not money), it takes <strong>effort</strong>, use your brain.
<!-- # Change your brain: learn to look for ways you can help -->
<!-- - open your brain -->
<!-- - use your brains, thinking is hard -->


//PROJECTS and YOU

#START SMALL
> be thorough

%climbers-climbers
<h2 class="overlay">BE A PRO or START SMALL</h2>
!! $ probably don't be learning craft on high-profile project
$ maybe learn on low-profile project (depending on owner)
- Sporting team analogy
- "going to contribute to Django today" srsly.
- don't learn here, learn "there"


%# expedition
Serious (1% projects) have serious, dedicated, committed, professional people

# whose time is precious
- committers are a very limited resource
- signing up to big-time project, *have different expectations*

%# core
That's why concept of "core" exists
- ecosystem around
- build up ranks
- make plugins


"STYLE"
Learn the “style” of the existing project. Phrasing, structure, etc.
There will probably be rules. Follow them. eg: PEP8
If in doubt: copy
Don’t make up a new style, you’ll look like a fool -- ASK!
<!--  - do what they do, follow procedure -->


"Cultural fit"


the software development methodologies adopted are not the same as those found in closed source development projects

%#Things you can do
Constructive Procrastination
 > students


Punch your weight
Play your strength
(For your first commit -- confident, easy: dinner parties/marathons)
Realistic expectations


# You might waltz straight in
- it's like farting

Engage socially
push-pull social networking github, socially-engaged stay longer
things are so easy on github (cycle is faster than ever)


%ass+hat
Tread Lightly around certain projects
<p>Some old-skool projects can be a bit hardcore.</p>
Linux-kernel I'm looking at you.

!shout
Drop your Ego
<p>We all want the project to be the best.</p>
It causes unnecessary friction and impedes your progress.

!shout
Learn to take "feedback" (ie criticism)
<p>This is actually a skill.</p>
Giving good constructive criticism is a really hard skill.



"Don't be in the cave"

Doesn't matter how smart your are, if you can't work in a team/reach concensus.
You will not be successful.

Lot of insecurity, nobody wants to look stupid.
"Myth of the Genius Programmer"


Failure is necessary.
Hot white fear you get, if you're going to: fail fast!
Failure is not a option is BS, failing on the same thing repeatedly.
Don't assign blame.

Rarely document failures.
Stop talking in private.



%#Things you can do as <strong>coder</strong>
<p><b>Code Review incoming patches</b>
  (can do anonymously)<p>
<p><b>Fix HTML or markup</b></p>
<p><b>Bug replication</b></p>
<p><b>Test out a beta or release candidate</b><br>(and do bug replications)</br>
<p><b>Help out on the <strong>Users list</strong>/IRC</b><br>
  (fielding questions)</p>

%#Things you can do as a <strong>coder</strong>
<p>Spend most your time:
<br>documenting
<br>maintaining
<br>fixing
<br>testing
<br><strong>reading</strong> code</p>
>>It's not all about the uber-ego commits

%#Things you can do as a <strong>coder</strong>
<h3>(Not 1%) Projects are really Flexible</h3>
- (Not top 1%), but rest FOSS is really flexible.
<p>Young projects can turn on a dime for your idea.</p>
<p>Envisioning and implementing <strong>all the details</strong><br>
  is expensive for new projects.</p>
>>Maybe it *is* about the uber-ego commits

%# Stable/Working > your ego (sorry.)
<p>Expect to get <strong>"feedback"</strong> (ie rejection)</p>
>> free ⊄ useful (!≟)

If you are not a coder
<h2>LEARN GITHUB</h2>
<p>This is the <strong>2014</strong> advice.<br>
 this may change but we're at a highwater mark for github right now</p>
Be comfortable with how to make contributions and everything else will be fine.


If you are not a coder
<h2>Use the tools your friends are using</h2>
 (the best support!)
<p>But use things that are <strong>easy to install</strong><br>
 (be kind to yourself, this day and age no need to suffer,
<br>can be all 'hardcore' later, crawl first.)



%#Things you can do as a <strong>non-coder</strong>
<p>Code Review (learning)<br>
Every project needs: designers, content makers, writers

# The world needs more technical lawyers!
- sincerely Eben Moglin, Karen Sandler

# The world needs more designers
- fight the "programming since 8" phenomenon



Things you can do
<h3>Ask your employer!</h3>
<p>Give back donate some of your time to the projects you use at work.</p>
<p>Openly License your internal packages/projects.</p>
I hear some of these projects can be quite popular *coughdjangocough.



%#Finding projects
<h3>YOU ARE AT A CONFERENCE NOW!</h3>
<p>- sprints</p>
<p>Tools/projects <strong>you use</strong></p>
<p>Projects <strong>people you know</strong> are working on</p>
<p>Projects within your <strong>"domain"</strong> (hockey, GIS, pigeon-racing)</p>

<p>No domain experience/knowledge required</p>
