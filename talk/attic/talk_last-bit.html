Centralized Version Control
<div class="halfR">
<h2><strong>SCCS</strong> (1972)<br />
<strong>RCS</strong> (1982)<br />
<strong>CVS</strong> (1986/9)<br />
<strong>SVN</strong> (2000)</h2>
Most of the Free Software ever developed.
</div>
All open source.

Distributed Version Control
DVCS wars early 2000s

Big difference surrounds "Forking":
Centralized "Forking" is BAD, and discouraged and is often an act of aggression
Distributed "Forking" is the first thing you do.

VCS History
<h3>3rd great era</h3>

VCS may change again
- sourceforge and github
- bear in mind `git` is a bit arse to use still
- article so recently as 2007! lauding sourceforge

# Start small
- take nothing else away
- Linus Stallman von Neuman
International Data Corporation (IDC)- drive by shootings, gotta know you, trust you

# Find out how/who communicate
# Find out how to commit

//CONCENTRATE

- $ git clone
- commit, push, pull

 >> in 2014 this is the advice,


>> conceptually it goes something like this:

- #1 reach out
|notice itch
|find code
|eyeball community

- #2 do your thing
|fork
|clone
|grep (or code, etc)
|commit, push (to your version)

- #3 send back
|pull request
|(comment/email)


#START SMALL
> be thorough

As a project owner
<h3>"Pull Request Zero"</h3>
<p>Have a non-code person who answers pull requests</p>
Not having any pull-request feedback makes me sad.


Don't reject things out of hand.

SET PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS
Probably the most valuable thing I’ve learnt in the last 5 years.
<h2>DO WHAT YOU SAY YOU’RE GOING TO DO (18%)</h2>
<p>   - But, if you can’t communicate!<br>
  - FOSS people are spectacularly understanding.</p>

SET PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS
<h2>TELL PEOPLE WHAT YOU’RE DOING</h2>
<p>   - For their sake.<br>
  - Save them from wondering.</p>

# Question: SOMEONE WHO HASN'T CONTRIBUTED BUT WANTS TO

>> What skills would you want to contribute
- What do you *want* to give to a project (create/do/build)

>> Tell us why, what do you feel is your barrier to entry
- What do you feel is stopping you?
- If you don't, but want to, why?
@Anna Ravenscroft


Fin:


Fun, compelling, interesting and challenging and we want to do it anyway.

Fun, chaotic, anarchic, opinionated >> FUN
Serendipidy: don't know where FLOSS will go
Zero marginal cost.
If we're clever and we work together we can attain what is probably the highest attainment in human history. Freedom.
Could be hyperbole but they say the "c ..."


(universal rule of life)
Communicate, Communicate, Communicate

(universal rule of life)
Make it OK for me to be here.
>> If there's no "place" for me, nowhere I can feel safe and comfortable, I'm not going to show, or I'm going to leave ASAP.
>> If you have any responsibility or control, you need to make that place.
eg. my first PyCon


# Interesting times
- Tech is becoming mainstream: Culture is changing
- Stream-lined ability to contribute/communicate.
- Re-learning old lessons.
- Demographic imbalance: Not just chicks, it’s older, multicultural.

# CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS
Difference is a continuum. Shared culture and technical knowledge. Skills!

- POTENTIAL

# Interesting times fin
- "Software"
- mainstreaming

- expropriation of "open source"
  farms, cars, localised economies

- Technical participation is changing

- There will always be some form of “Open Source”.
- People like us will make it happen.
- FLOSS will probably change the world (probably already has)
- FLOSS may play a pivotal role in saving the world (from ourselves)
- Disconnection between people and digital technology (shouldn't be, not insurmountable problem)x
