<h2>The answer is in you.</h2>


//PROJECTS and YOU

<!-- %topo1 -->
<!-- $ what you know -->
<!-- # Domain Knowledge -->
<!-- - mountaineers, walkers, it's just different -->

<!-- %topo2 -->
<!-- $ what skills you have -->
<!-- %topo3 -->
<!-- $ what some random project owner's skills are -->

Just because you're a PhD in CS doesn't mean you're a good software engineer,
Just because you're a good software engineer doesn't mean you're a good devops
Just because you're any of the above doesn't mean you can deal with a letter from a lawyer.
Projects need all of the above skills.
# no point can you be judgy skills of other, remind yourself constantly that you have your own skillset not to be compared with others

<h2>Learn to Look</h2>
<p>Have a good <strong>internal sense</strong> of when you're using
Free Software
(which I trust everyone here does ...)

Think like a Contributor
<h2>Learn to Look</h2>
<p>Rather than being a passive user, make an effort:</p>
  - When you find bugs, replicate them properly and report them<br>
  - Read and understand documentation<br>
  <span class="gap">(for clarity and coherence)</span><br>
   - Details, details, details (spelling, cruft)</p>
You're contributing your time and energy (not money), it takes <strong>effort</strong>, use your brain.
<!-- # Change your brain: learn to look for ways you can help -->
<!-- - open your brain -->
<!-- - use your brains, thinking is hard -->


<p class="top2"> - When you find <strong>bugs</strong>:
  <br><span class="gap"><strong>replicate</strong> them <strong>properly</strong> and <strong>report</strong> them</span><br>
  - <strong>Read and understand</strong> documentation<br>
  <span class="gap">(for clarity and coherence)</span><br>
  - <strong>Details</strong>, details, details (spelling, cruft)</p>

<h2>Serious/famous projects have

  <br><strong>committed</strong>, <strong>professional </strong>
  <br>people working on them</h2>

%# core
That's why concept of "core" exists
<div class="overlay">
  <p>That's why there's an "Ecosystem" around big projects</p>
  <p>
    ~ Work up ranks through long hours<br>
    ~ Make <strong>plugins</strong><br>
    ~ Be a good "<strong>Cultural fit</strong>"

  <h2>BE A PRO or START SMALL</h2>

  !! $ probably don't be learning craft on high-profile project
$ maybe learn on low-profile project (depending on owner)
- Sporting team analogy
- "going to contribute to Django today" srsly.
- don't learn here, learn "there"
- signing up to big-time project, *have different expectations*

<h2>Start Small</h2>
This is not the last time I'm going to say this.


2 meanings:
drive by shootings, gotta know you, trust you
>> #2 message
# Start small
- take nothing else away

<h2>Find out how to (who)<br><strong>communicate</strong></h2>
<h2>Find out how to <br><strong>commit</strong></h2>

Style
<p><strong>Learn the "style"</strong> of the existing project.<br>
  <span class="gap">(Phrasing, structure, etc)</span></p>
<p>There will probably be <strong>rules</strong>.<br>
  <span class="gap">Follow them (eg, PEP)</span></p>
<p>If in doubt: <br>
  <strong>copy</strong><br>
  Don’t make up a new style, you’ll look like a fool -- ASK!</p>
Step where they step.

confident, easy: Like dinner parties and marathons don't attempt something you've never done before.
You might waltz straight in.

%#Things you can do
<h2>Constructive Procrastination</h2>
  <p>
    students?<br>
    bored with work?
  </p>
Gotta procrastinate? Want to alleviate some guilt?
>> Some of the best projects are the fruit of procrastinating Uni/PhD students.

Things you can do
  <h2>Engage Socially</h2>
  <p>You are statistically more likely to stay involved with the project for longer.</p>
push-pull social networking github, socially-engaged stay longer
Things are so easy on github (cycle is faster than ever)

Be Overly Modest
<div class="halfL">
  <p class="overlay">Check me out! I'm awesome</p>
  <p class="overlay right">You suck!</p>
</div>

<div class="halfR">
  <p class="overlay">I'm not very good</p>
  <p class="overlay right">Wow! You're awesome</p>
</div>
With the occasional notable exception, a strong cultural feature of FOSS

!shout
<h2><strong>Drop your Ego</strong></h2>
<p class="top12">We all want the project to be the best.</p>
It causes unnecessary friction and impedes your progress.

!shout
<h2>Learn to take "feedback"<br> <span class="gap">(ie criticism)</span></h2>
<p class="top8">Accepting criticism is actually a skill.
  <br>YOU ARE <strong>NOT</strong> YOUR CODE.
</p>

Giving <strong>good constructive criticism</strong> is a <strong>really hard</strong> skill.
